# Who is hex4a?
I'm a Digital Forensic Analyst and former Forensic R&D who dabbles in malware / threat research from time to time - I don't consider myself a CTFer, but have participated in some that pique my interest, mostly participating for the fun malware and forensics challenges!

# What is this?
This is a silly blog where I catalogue CTF writeups, malware and threat research, and other ramblings that I think to write about.

### Why am I here?
I ask myself that question every day 😄

#### Who am I?
Are you okay?

##### I don't know who I am!
